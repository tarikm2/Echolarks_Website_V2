Gloria Grey 
You're as sweet as they say
I've loved you now for
Three thousand days
Twenty Two hours and two minutes past
You've loved me now for
Much less
What can I do

Angela Stone 
You're as hard as they come
I've written poems
I've written you psalms
I've swindled tyrants and taken their crowns
Gave you their halo's
You put 'em all down 
What can I do

'Cause when I met you
I was struck down
I was blinded
Broken in two 
But now I'm just waiting for you to come 'round

Victoria Swan 
You're just 
All that I want
I turned down the bedsheets for you to come home
And when you come
Will you be
dressed up in white
Blood on your heels but you're tangled in light
What can I do

'Cause when I met you
You were lonely 
You were looking for somebody new 
But now I'm just waiting for you to come 'round

Gloria Grey
Since you left I've been stuck in a daze
Correspondence sent by paper plane
Broken words in a broken slang

Long is the day
Long is the night
May someday you find peace in your life
May your love find a place in the light

Cause when I met you
I was blinded 
And you were looking for somebody new 
But now I'm just waiting for you to come 'round
All alone at the foot of your tower 
I'm just waiting for you to come 'round
