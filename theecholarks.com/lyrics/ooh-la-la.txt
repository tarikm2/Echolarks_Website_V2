A Chandelier hung high
A table set with knives
A minor bird outside
Watches you arrive
Walk into the room
And all of my pages come unglued 
They now belong to you

Show me where you've been
From where did you descend 
The mouths of seraphim 
To find me lost within
A dark afternoon 
Nothing to be nowhere of use
And then I was with you

'Cause I lived a lonely life
In queue for the afterlife 
but suddenly all I see is you

A chandelier untied 
A table painted white
The bread beside the wine
The doors are opened wide
You come into view
I stand in the perfect shade of you
It's all that I can do

Aviate my mind
Fly me like a kite
You are everything I've been without
Diamond crooked spine 
Ruby lipstick smile
Washes over me
I can't come down
This song belongs to you 

'Cause I lived a lonely life 
Waiting for an afterlife 
But suddenly all I see is you
