Eloquence I need you
The words they hardly seem to
Tumble from my mind
They never quite align 

And I was trying to reach you
Through vapor trails I watched you
Vanish from my sight
Decay under the light

I want what heaven steals
I want what you conceal
And so as the days betray
They're distant and out of body
And they take advantage of you in every single way

Innocence I want you
In visions howling out to
In bleary sleeping nights
In echoes out of time

And you I still remember 
The ashes under embers
With lovers in the know
In gilded skin and bone

Indifference I've known you
Alone inside your bedroom 
Your pale and fractured walls
Your loveless life absolved
