You're the sun
You're the evening star upon us
You're the deep blue
Who are they to ever question 
What you say or do
Though darling you can be so
awfully cruel
Only for you would I Little Boots 

As you dance through the halls I watch and wonder what processes you
Mother's gone, Grandfather too, and now your nephew
Who is left that can love you the way that I do
Only for you would I Little Boots

I still picture you as a child my love
Though now you rule the world

You can spill from your mouth abominations of the worst kind
Still I'll hold a place in heaven for you at my side
Forgiven for all that you do
Only for you would I Little Boots
