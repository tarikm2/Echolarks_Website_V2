Wasted on a dream
I tried to burn a path with gasoline 
My keys across a dark black limousine 
But all to no avail 

Wasted on a dream
I saw it in a bright white magazine 
The only way I knew to be redeemed was tear it all apart 

And there was a new religion waking in my mind
Whatever had come before I left it all behind
'Cause God only knows the way I feel

Wasted on a dream
In helter skelter shades of seventeen 
I only wished to break the stained-glass scene
Just to hear it crashing down 

Wasted on a dream 
Comes over like a strange amphetamine
I walk the figure 8 so endlessly  
Alone and in the dark

Got me runnin' through the dead of dessert 
Joan of Arc singing Don't Be Cruel
Jumped in the river and exit more confused 

Wasted on a dream 
The string beneath my wrist shakes violently 
Not sleeping or awake but in between 
Just playing on and on

Wasted on a dream
The song of all the sailors lost at sea
Comes rolling through the tide and back to me
I hear them coming home 

And there was a new religion waking in my mind
Born out of the dead-end streets I walked through small town life
Whatever had come before I left it all behind
'Cause God only knows the way I feel
