Before that summer I walked the rooftops in a mood
Above the Kidron
She broke like glass into my view
Shattering all of the listless afternoons
And swaying under the moon

I sent out for her
While blood was spilling down your sword
I made the offer
I pulled the veil around my room
As oceans crawled out of tune beneath my crime
In shadows of the Devine

Unto your symphony I sleep
And in my waking hours repeat
And though these secrets I can't keep
Unto your symphony I sleep

I can remember
You walking through the palace doors
War torn and battered
You put your face down to the floor
And from my pen fell the words that split my mind
Up to the front of the line
